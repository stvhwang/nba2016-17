# nba2016-17 Project : The Point of Improbable Return
**This is a work in progress**
*This project was created as part of the Data Analytics class at Galvanize and highlights my SQL, Tableau and Excel skills.*

<<<<<<< HEAD
The project's aim is to query games from the NBA's play by play data for the 2016-17 season and determine the threshold when a game's point differential is unlikely to overcome by the losing team. I call this threshold The Point of Improbable Return. Nomially, I set it trigger when the scoring differential is twice that of time remaining in minutes.

After finding some games where a comback was successful, querying which players score the most in the time after this threshold. The premise is to find the players who have the ability score to help their team overcome a losing situation and help produce a come-from-behind win.
