# nba2016-17 Project : The Point of Improbable Return
**This is a work in progress**
*This project was created as part of the Data Analytics class at Galvanize and highlights my SQL, Tableau and Excel skills.*

The project's aim is to query the NBA's play by play data for the 2016-17 season and determine the threshold when a game's point differential is nigh impossible to overcome. Then querying which players score the most in the time after this threshold. The premise is to find the players who have the ability score to help their team overcome a losing situation and produce a win.
